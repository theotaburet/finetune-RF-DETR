# Fine-tuning RF-DETR Pipeline

A modular fine-tuning pipeline for [RF-DETR](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr) (Real-time DEtection TRansformer) models.

## Introduction 📖

The RF-DETR Training Pipeline simplifies the process of fine-tuning [RF-DETR](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr) (Real-time DEtection TRansformer) models for object detection tasks. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that handles everything from dataset preparation to model training and inference, enabling users to leverage state-of-the-art detection capabilities without deep expertise in machine learning pipelines.

## Motivation 💡

Fine-tuning large vision models like [RF-DETR](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr) can be daunting due to the need for data preprocessing, configuration management, and training orchestration. This pipeline bridges that gap by offering a modular, CLI-driven approach that democratizes access to advanced object detection. Whether you're a researcher prototyping new ideas or a developer integrating detection into applications, the pipeline reduces boilerplate and accelerates iteration.

## Features ✨

This pipeline combines powerful functionality with developer-friendly design to streamline your RF-DETR fine-tuning workflow. Here's what makes it stand out:

- **Simple CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools for all pipeline stages
- **Dataset Management**: Download datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) with built-in authentication (see the [Kaggle API docs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api))
- **Format Conversion**: Automatic conversion from YOLO to COCO format with customizable splits
- **Flexible Training**: YAML-based configuration for reproducible training runs
- **Auto Device Detection**: Automatically selects GPU/CPU based on availability
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for easy extension and maintenance
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase
- **Testing**: Unit tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and coverage tracking
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions)
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic code quality checks with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)

## Approach 🎯

The pipeline architecture is built around three core principles: simplicity, reliability, and extensibility. Each component is designed to work independently while integrating seamlessly into the complete workflow.

### 1. Data Pipeline

The pipeline implements a robust data handling system:

- **Download Module**: Integrates with the [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) for seamless dataset acquisition
- **Format Conversion**: Parses YOLO annotations and converts to COCO format with proper validation
- **Smart Splitting**: Configurable train/valid/test splits with shuffling
- **Bbox Validation**: Ensures bounding boxes are within image bounds and have positive dimensions

### 2. Configuration Management

- **YAML-based configs**: Human-readable training configurations (see [config/README.md](config/README.md))
- **Automatic overrides**: CLI arguments override config file values
- **Device auto-detection**: Automatically selects CUDA if available, falls back to CPU

### 3. CLI Design

- **Hierarchical commands**: Organized as `python -m rf_detr_finetuning <command> <subcommand>`
  - **Type validation**: Uses [jsonargparse](https://jsonargparse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for automatic type checking and help generation
  - **Clear documentation**: Docstrings automatically converted to CLI help messages

## Installation 📦

Getting started is straightforward. Install the package in editable mode with the extras that match your needs.

```bash
pip install -e .[cli,data]
```

<summary>Development Installation</summary>

```bash
pip install -e .[dev,cli,data]
pre-commit install
```

</details>

## Quick Start 🚀

Follow these steps to get up and running with RF-DETR fine-tuning in minutes. The workflow covers dataset acquisition, preparation, training, and inference.

### Dataset Download

Use the local CLI to download datasets. For example, to download the CCTV Weapon Dataset from Kaggle:

```bash
uv run -m rf_detr_finetuning download kaggle-dataset --name simuletic/cctv-weapon-dataset --dest data
```

If authentication fails, set up your Kaggle API credentials in ~/.config/kaggle/kaggle.json or via the
KAGGLE_USERNAME/KAGGLE_KEY environment variables, then re-run the command. Make sure you have accepted any
dataset rules on Kaggle to avoid a 403 error.

### Dataset Conversion

To convert a YOLO dataset to COCO format with train/valid/test splits:

```bash
uv run -m rf_detr_finetuning convert yolo-to-coco \
  --input_dir path/to/yolo/dataset \
  --output_dir path/to/output \
  --split_ratios 0.8 0.1 0.1 \
  --class_names '{"0": "person", "1": "weapon"}'
```

### Training

To train the model on the prepared dataset:

```bash
uv run -m rf_detr_finetuning train \
  --config config/sample_config.yaml \
  --dataset data/my-dataset_coco
```

The device (GPU/CPU) is automatically detected and set.

### Prediction

Once training is complete, run inference on new images using your trained model:

```bash
uv run -m rf_detr_finetuning predict \
  --model_path output/checkpoint_best_total.pth \
  --image_path path/to/test/image.jpg \
  --confidence 0.5
```

This will display the detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores. In headless environments,
the annotated image is saved to output/prediction.png.

## Real Use Case 🎥

To illustrate the pipeline's capabilities, we've included a complete example using the CCTV Weapon Detection dataset. See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for a complete walkthrough of weapon detection in CCTV footage using this pipeline.
